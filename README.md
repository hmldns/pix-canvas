# üé® Collaborative Pixel Canvas

A real-time collaborative digital art space where anonymous visitors can draw pixels together on a shared canvas. This project serves as a comprehensive technological demonstrator, showcasing both cutting-edge web technologies (WebRTC, WebSockets, high-performance canvas rendering) and the emerging paradigm of AI-driven development‚Äîwhere complete applications are systematically compiled from detailed specifications using coding agents.

*Real-time collaborative pixel drawing with live cursors and chat*

## üéØ What Is This?

Infinite Pixel Canvas is a browser-based collaborative art platform where users can:

- **Draw Together**: Place pixels in real-time with other anonymous users
- **See Live Presence**: Watch other users' cursors move across the canvas
- **Chat & Connect**: Communicate via peer-to-peer chat while creating
- **Explore Canvas**: Navigate a 5000x5000 pixel grid with smooth zoom/pan
- **Join Instantly**: No registration required - jump in and start creating

The project serves as both an engaging creative platform and a comprehensive demonstration of modern web technologies working in harmony.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Made

This project was architected and built using **[Nautex AI](https://nautex.ai)**, a development platform that provides systematic guidance for coding agents. The development process followed a structured approach:

### üìã Requirements & Planning
- **[PRD.md](.nautex/docs/PRD.md)** - Complete product specification with user stories and functional requirements
- **[TRD.md](.nautex/docs/TRD.md)** - Technical architecture, API design, and implementation strategy  
- **[FILE.md](.nautex/docs/FILE.md)** - Detailed project structure and file organization

### ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development
The entire codebase was implemented using **Claude Code** as the coding agent, following the systematic task breakdown provided by Nautex AI. This approach ensured:

- **Methodical Implementation**: Layer-by-layer development from core functionality to advanced features
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing strategy with integration tests for backend services
- **Consistent Architecture**: Monorepo structure with shared types and utilities
- **Performance Focus**: 60 FPS rendering target with optimized WebGL and object pooling

### üè≠ Key Engineering Decisions

**Real-time Architecture**: Hybrid approach using WebSockets for reliable pixel state synchronization and WebRTC data channels for low-latency cursor movements and ephemeral chat.

**Scalable Data Model**: Append-only pixel storage with last-write-wins semantics, enabling horizontal scaling and maintaining complete drawing history.

**Performance Optimization**: PixiJS with GPU-accelerated rendering, procedural particle effects, and intelligent Level-of-Detail grid rendering based on zoom level.

**Anonymous User Experience**: Cookie-based sessions with auto-generated usernames, eliminating friction while maintaining persistent contributions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pix-canvas

# Start all services with Docker
make up

# Or run in development mode
make dev-frontend  # Terminal 1
