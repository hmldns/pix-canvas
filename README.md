# üé® Collaborative Pixel Canvas

A real-time collaborative digital art space where anonymous visitors can draw pixels together on a shared canvas. This project serves as a comprehensive technological demonstrator, showcasing both cutting-edge web technologies (WebRTC, WebSockets, high-performance canvas rendering) and the emerging paradigm of AI-driven development‚Äîwhere complete applications are systematically compiled from detailed specifications using coding agents.

## üéØ What Is This?

Infinite Pixel Canvas is a browser-based collaborative art platform where users can:

- **Draw Together**: Place pixels in real-time with other anonymous users
- **See Live Presence**: Watch other users' cursors move across the canvas
- **Chat & Connect**: Communicate via peer-to-peer chat while creating
- **Explore Canvas**: Navigate a 5000x5000 pixel grid with smooth zoom/pan
- **Join Instantly**: No registration required - jump in and start creating

The project serves as both an engaging creative platform and a comprehensive demonstration of modern web technologies working in harmony.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Made

This project demonstrates the complete **specification-to-code** development paradigm using **[Nautex AI](https://github.com/hmldns/nautex)** acting as Architect, Technical Product Manager, and Project Manager for **Claude Code**. 

### Development Flow & Artifacts

#### üéØ 1. Requirements Gathering
- Interactive briefing session with Nautex AI chatbot
- Comprehensive exploration of project vision, gathering questions and ideas
- **‚Üí Produces**: Initial product and technical specifications

#### üìù 2. Specification Refinement  
- Iterative refinement process within Nautex app
- Filling details and resolving TODOs flagged during analysis
- **‚Üí Produces**: Finalized PRD and TRD documents

#### üóÇÔ∏è 3. Codebase Architecture Planning
- Pre-planned file organization mapped to specific requirements
- Every file location determined before coding begins
- **‚Üí Produces**: Complete FILE structure document

#### üìã 4. Task Planning & Decomposition
- Granular coding, testing, and review tasks planned in structured layers
- Reviews scheduled early to verify alignment and demonstrate incremental progress
- **‚Üí Produces**: Executable task plan with file/requirement references

#### üì• 5. Export & Synchronization
- All artifacts (PRD, TRD, FILE) exported from Nautex app
- **[Nautex MCP](https://github.com/hmldns/nautex)** enables synchronization
- **‚Üí Delivers**: 
  - **[PRD.md](.nautex/docs/PRD.md)** - Product requirements document
  - **[TRD.md](.nautex/docs/TRD.md)** - Technical requirements document
  - **[FILE.md](.nautex/docs/FILE.md)** - File structure mapping
  - Live task stream via MCP to coding agent

#### ü§ñ 6. Systematic Code Execution
- **Claude Code** receives synchronized specifications and tasks
- Implements each task following pre-defined guidance
- Zero architectural decisions required‚Äîall planning completed upfront
- **‚Üí Produces**: Complete, specification-aligned codebase

This approach ensured:
- **Predictable Outcomes**: Complete application built exactly to specification
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing strategy with integration tests
- **Consistent Architecture**: Monorepo structure with shared types and utilities  
- **Performance Focus**: 60 FPS rendering target with optimized WebGL and object pooling

### üè≠ Key Engineering Decisions

**Real-time Architecture**: Hybrid approach using WebSockets for reliable pixel state synchronization and WebRTC data channels for low-latency cursor movements and ephemeral chat.

**Scalable Data Model**: Append-only pixel storage with last-write-wins semantics, enabling horizontal scaling and maintaining complete drawing history.

**Performance Optimization**: PixiJS with GPU-accelerated rendering, procedural particle effects, and intelligent Level-of-Detail grid rendering based on zoom level.

**Anonymous User Experience**: Cookie-based sessions with auto-generated usernames, eliminating friction while maintaining persistent contributions.
